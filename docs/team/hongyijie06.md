### Code Contributed: [Link to tP Code Dashboard](https://nus-cs2113-ay2324s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=hongyijie06&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2024-02-23&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=false)
### Enhancements Implemented
- **V1.0: Added the ability to attempt questions by topic**
    - **What it does:** Allows users to focus on specific topics for revision.
    - **Justification:** Allows users to get more targeted practice to enjoy a more efficient study session.
    -  **Highlights:** Required organized class structure, applied module concepts like class diagrams to handle many classes.
- **V2.0: Added a timed mode**
    - **What it does:** Allows the user to set a time limit for the question set they want to attempt.
    - **Justification:** This feature allows users to simulate exam conditions to answer within the time limit to gauge their familiarity with the concepts.
    - **Highlights:** The method involved implementing inner classes.
      It was challenging implementing the inner class as the implementation details are different from regular classes practiced in the module.
    - **Credits:** Watched a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/QEF62Fm81h4?si=GPR9-J0K1zdsS588) on how to use timer and timer task abstract classes in the Java library. 
- **Enhancement of Existing features: Integration using UI of pause feature when starting a new session** (e.g. [#84](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-1/tp/pull/84))
    - **What it does:** Users get to decide if they want to continue their previous session
- **Enhancement of Existing features: access to solutions and explanations only after attempting** (e.g. [#44](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-1/tp/pull/44))
    - **Justification:** Allows the user to practice active recall to attempt the questions first rather than taking a passive approach to solely read the solutions and explanations in their revision.
